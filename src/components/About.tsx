      Hi, I'm Marvin! I’m a software engineer based in New York City with a
      passion for technology and development. During my internship at TodayTix
      Group, I contributed to launching a rewards system that impacted over
      500,000 users, focusing on backend development using Groovy and SQL.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm a quick learner who enjoys taking on new challenges. Currently, I'm
      writing an interpreter in Go and honing my skills in data structures and
      algorithms.
      <br />
      <br />
      Beyond tech, I have interests in football, video games, anime, manga,
      traveling, and movies.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm actively seeking software engineering and adjacent roles, including
      Fullstack, Frontend, Backend, QA, and DevOps.
      <br />
      <br />
      Below are details of my journey, projects I’d like to highlight, and my
      contact information!
