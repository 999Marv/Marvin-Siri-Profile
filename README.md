# Marvin Siri Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my work experience, skills, projects, and provides a way for others to contact me.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website is designed with a minimalistic approach, using a simple color scheme of red, black, and off-white/cream. The purpose of this site is to highlight my skills, experience, and provide easy navigation through sections such as "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact."
